What is a data structure?
--------------------------
  > A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. 
    (or) A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. 
  > JavaScript has primitive (built in) and non-primitive (not built in) data structures.

    1. Primitive data types: ( Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol )
        > The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. 
          Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.
       
    2. Non-primitive data types: ( Object ) ==> Non-Primitive data type has only one member i.e. the Object.
        > The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types.   
          It is also known as derived data types or reference data types.
        
        > the Non-primitive data structures is derived into two types
          1. linear data structure: 
              The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure.
              The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues.
              In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.
          2. non-linear data structure:
              When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a non-linear data structure.
              The best example is trees and graphs. 
              In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.

Linked list ?

    > the music players also use the same technique to switch between music.
    > web pages can be accessed using the previous and the next URL links which are linked using linked list.



Stacks ?
--------------------------
  > realtime time examples 
    > history of viewed websites
    > call logs, e-mails, google photos, any gallery, youtube downloads, notifications (latest appears first)




Queues ?
--------------------------
  > realtime time examples 
    > sending an email. it will be queued
    > server while responding request
