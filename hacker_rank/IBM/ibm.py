#  A simple cipher is built on the alphabet wheel  which has uppercase English letters ['A'-'Z'] written on it:

# Given an encrypted string consisting of English letters ['A'-'Z']  only, decrypt the string by replacing each character with the  character away on the wheel in the counter-clockwise direction.  Counter-clockwise is the opposite direction in which the hands on a clock usually move. In the image, Z is 1 unit counter-clockwise from A.

# example:
# encrypted = 'VTAOG'
# k = 2
 

def simpleCipher(encrypted, k):
    # Write your code here
    alphabet = list('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
    result = ''

    for char in encrypted:
        if char.isalpha():
            new_index = (alphabet.index(char) - k) % len(alphabet)
            result += alphabet[new_index]
        else:
            result += char

    return result


    
    
# Madam C.J. Walker is historically renowned for becoming the first African-American businesswoman in America. One of her business plans involving the sale of cosmetics and perfumes for women is a modification of the standard 0-1 knapsack problem.

# Walker's business plan begins with an array of n items. She wants to buy products and resell them for profit. The cost of buying the i ^ (th) item is cost jr and it earns her a profit of 2 ^ i She has a total of x amount of money.

# Find the maximum profit that can be generated for the given amount of money. As the answer can be rather large, report the answer as maxProfit % (10 ^ 9 + 7) where % denotes modulo operator.

# Example

# Suppose there are n = 5 items with costs cos t = lfloor10 rfloor 20, 14, 40, 50 ], and the initial amount of money that Walker has is x = 70

# Some possible combination of items Walker can buy are:

# She can buy items 0, 1, and 2 for a cost of 44 and obtain a profit of 2 ^ 0 + 2 ^ 1 + 2 ^ 2 = 7

# She can buy items 0 and 4 for a cost of 60 and obtain a profit of 2 ^ 0 + 2 ^ 4 = 17

# She can buy items 1 and 4 for a cost of 70 and obtain a profit of 2 ^ 1 + 2 ^ 4 = 18

# â€¢ She can buy items 2 and 4 for a cost of 64 anit obtain a profit of 3 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 4 * 20

# Out of all the possible combinations, the maximum
