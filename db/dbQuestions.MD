# **Indexing in Databases**

Indexing is a technique used in databases to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. It works by creating a separate data structure that allows the database to locate rows quickly without scanning the entire table.

Indexes in PostgreSQL are similar to an index in a bookâ€”they help the database find data faster instead of scanning every row.

### **How Indexing Improves Performance**

1. **Reduces Scan Time:** Instead of a full table scan, the database uses the index to find data efficiently.
2. **Speeds Up WHERE Queries:** Indexing helps in fast lookups when filtering using `WHERE` conditions.
3. **Optimizes Joins:** Indexes improve the performance of `JOIN` operations by allowing quick row lookups.
4. **Enhances ORDER BY and GROUP BY:** Sorting and grouping operations perform better with indexes.

### **Types of Indexes in PostgreSQL**

1. **B-Tree Index (Default)**
2. **Hash Index**
3. **GIN Index (Generalized Inverted Index)**
4. **GiST Index (Generalized Search Tree)**
5. **BRIN Index (Block Range INdex)**

### **Code Examples in PostgreSQL**

#### **1. Creating a Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary NUMERIC
);
```

#### **2. Inserting Sample Data**

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES
('Alice', 'HR', 50000),
('Bob', 'IT', 70000),
('Charlie', 'Finance', 60000),
('David', 'IT', 75000);
```

#### **3. Query Performance Without Index**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
```

Without an index, PostgreSQL performs a **sequential scan**, meaning it checks every row.

---

### **Adding an Index**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON employees(department);
```

Now, running the query again:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
```

With the index, PostgreSQL will use an **index scan**, which is significantly faster.

---

### **4. Unique Index**

Ensures uniqueness in a column:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_name ON employees(name);
```

---

### **5. Composite Index**

For multiple columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department_salary ON employees(department, salary);
```

This improves queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 60000;
```

---

### **6. Partial Index**

Creates an index for specific conditions:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_high_salary ON employees(salary) WHERE salary > 60000;
```

This is useful when filtering on high salaries frequently.

---

### **7. Dropping an Index**

If an index is no longer needed:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_department;
```

---

### **8. Checking Index Usage**

To see if an index is being used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'employees';
```

---

### **Conclusion**

Indexing in PostgreSQL significantly enhances query performance, especially for large datasets. However, excessive indexing can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations due to maintenance overhead.
