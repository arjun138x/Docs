> What is TypeScript, and how does it relate to JavaScript?
  > TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 
    It enhances JavaScript with static typing, interfaces, enums, and other features.

> What are the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript?
  > Benefits include static typing for error detection, better code maintainability, improved IDE support with IntelliSense, 
    and the ability to catch common errors during development.

> How do you declare variables in TypeScript?
  > Variables are declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords, optionally followed by a colon (:) and the type annotation.

> What are type annotations in TypeScript?
  > Type annotations are used to explicitly specify the type of a variable, parameter, or return value. 
    They help enforce type safety and provide clarity in code.

> What is the difference between interfaces and classes in TypeScript?
  > Interfaces define contracts for objects by specifying their structure. Classes, on the other hand, 
    are blueprints for creating objects that can have properties and methods.

> How do you create custom types in TypeScript?
  > Custom types can be created using interfaces, type aliases, enums, and classes. 
    Interfaces are commonly used to define object shapes, while type aliases provide a way to name complex types.

> Explain the concept of type inference in TypeScript.
  > Type inference is TypeScript's ability to automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its initialization value. 
    This helps reduce the need for explicit type annotations.

> What are generics in TypeScript, and how do you use them?
  > Generics allow writing reusable code that works with multiple types. 
    They enable the creation of flexible and type-safe functions, classes, and interfaces.

> How does TypeScript handle the concept of null and undefined?
  > TypeScript has strict null checking by default, meaning variables cannot be assigned 
    null or undefined unless explicitly allowed using the `strictNullChecks` compiler option.

> What is the "any" type in TypeScript, and when should you use it?
   > The `any` type in TypeScript represents values of any type. It's often used when working with dynamic data 
    or when interfacing with JavaScript libraries that don't have type definitions.


> How do you handle asynchronous operations in TypeScript?
  > Asynchronous operations in TypeScript can be handled using Promises, async/await syntax, or callback functions. 
    Promises offer a clean way to handle asynchronous code, while async/await provides a more readable and synchronous-like syntax.

> Explain the differences between "interface" and "type" in TypeScript.
  > Interfaces are mainly used for object shapes and contract definitions, while type aliases can represent any type, 
    including primitives, unions, intersections, and more. Interfaces can be extended and merged, 
    whereas type aliases are more flexible and support complex types.

> How do you compile TypeScript code to JavaScript?
  > TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). You can compile TypeScript files 
    individually or configure the compiler to watch for changes and compile the entire project.

> What are decorators in TypeScript, and how do you use them?
  > Decorators are a feature of TypeScript used to add metadata or modify the behavior of classes, methods, properties, 
  or parameters at design time. They are declared using the `@decoratorName` syntax and can be applied to various targets.

> How does TypeScript support ECMAScript features, such as async/await and arrow functions?
  > TypeScript supports ECMAScript features such as async/await and arrow functions by compiling them to 
    equivalent ECMAScript code that can run in modern JavaScript environments.

> What is the "readonly" keyword in TypeScript, and how is it used?
  > The `readonly` keyword is used in TypeScript to make properties immutable after initialization. 
    It ensures that properties cannot be reassigned after they are initially set.

> How does TypeScript support modules, and what module formats does it allow?
  > TypeScript supports modules using various module formats, including CommonJS, AMD, UMD, SystemJS, and ES6 modules. 
    It allows developers to organize code into reusable and maintainable modules.

> Can you explain the concept of union and intersection types in TypeScript?
  > Union types allow a value to be of multiple types, while intersection types combine multiple types into a single type. 
    Union types are denoted using the `|` operator, and intersection types are denoted using the `&` operator.

> How do you configure TypeScript compiler options?
  > TypeScript compiler options can be configured using a `tsconfig.json` file or passed as command-line arguments 
    to the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Options include specifying target ECMAScript version, 
    module format, output directory, and strictness level.

> What is the "strict" mode in TypeScript, and why is it recommended?
  > The "strict" mode in TypeScript enables a set of strict type-checking options, including `strictNullChecks`, 
    `strictFunctionTypes`, `strictPropertyInitialization`, and others. It helps catch common programming errors 
    and promotes writing safer and more predictable code.



TypeScript data types and related concepts:
--------------------------------------------

  > String :- The `string` type represents textual data.
    let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";

  > Number :- The `number` type represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.
    let count: number = 10;

  > Boolean :- The `boolean` type represents a logical value indicating true or false.
    let isValid: boolean = true;

  > Any :- The `any` type allows assigning values of any type, useful for when the type of a variable is not known in advance.
    let variable: any = 10;
    variable = "Hello";
    variable = true;
    
  > Arrays :- Arrays allow storing multiple values of the same type.
    let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
  > Tuples :- Tuples are arrays with fixed lengths and fixed types for each element.
    let tuple: [string, number] = ["John", 25];
    
  > Union :- Union types allow variables to have more than one type.
    let value: string | number;
    value = "Hello";
    value = 10;
    
  > Enum :- Enums allow defining a set of named constants.
    enum Color {
        Red,
        Green,
        Blue
    }
    let color: Color = Color.Red;

  > Objects :- In TypeScript, objects are key-value pairs. Each value in the object 
    has a corresponding key, and the key can be used to access the value.

    let person: { name: string, age: number } = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    };

    > In the above example, `person` is an object with two properties: `name` and `age`. 
      The properties have specified types (`string` for `name` and `number` for `age`).

  > Type Assertion :- Type assertion is a way to tell the TypeScript compiler to treat a variable as a specific type, 
    even if the compiler can't infer it automatically.

    let message: any = "Hello, TypeScript!";
    let strLength: number = (message as string).length;

    > Here, we're telling TypeScript that `message` should be treated as a `string`, so we can access its `length` property. 
      Type assertions can be done using the `as` keyword or angle brackets (`<>`).

  > null and undefined :- `null` and `undefined` are values in TypeScript that represent the absence of a value.
    > null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. 
      It is a value that can be assigned to a variable to signify that the variable has no value.
    > undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It also indicates the absence of a value.

    let data: number | null | undefined;

    > In the above example, `data` can hold a value of type `number`, `null`, or `undefined`. 
      This is useful for scenarios where a variable might not always have a value.
    > In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` are both subtypes of all other types, which means you can 
      assign them to variables of any type (unless strict null checks are enabled).

    let numberValue: number = null; // This works if strictNullChecks is disabled
    let stringValue: string = undefined; // This works if strictNullChecks is disabled

    > However, if `strictNullChecks` is enabled in the TypeScript configuration, you can't assign `null` or `undefined` 
      to variables unless explicitly allowed through union types or type assertion.

    let numberValue: number | null = null; // Allowed with union types
    let stringValue: string = undefined as string; // Allowed with type assertion

  > Functions, Parameters, Optional Parameters, Return Type, Return Void, Never
    > Functions perform a task or calculate a value. Parameters are variables declared in the function's signature. 
      Optional parameters are parameters that may or may not be provided. Return type specifies the type of value returned by the function. 
      Functions returning `void` don't return a value. Functions returning `never` never produce a return value.

    function greet(name: string): string {
        return "Hello, " + name;
    }

    function log(message: string): void {
        console.log(message);
    }

    function throwError(message: string): never {
        throw new Error(message);
    }

    function sum(a: number, b?: number): number {
        return b ? a + b : a;
    }

  > Interfaces vs Custom Types :- Interfaces define a contract for objects. Custom types (using `type`) define aliases for other types.

    interface Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    type PersonType = {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    };
    
  > Unknown vs Any :- `unknown` is the type-safe counterpart of `any`. Values of type `unknown` can't be 
    assigned to other types without type assertion or type narrowing.

    let userInput: unknown;
    let userName: string;

    userInput = 5;
    userInput = 'Max';

    // This will result in an error
    // userName = userInput; 

    if (typeof userInput === 'string') {
        userName = userInput;
    }
    
  > Classes, Access Modifiers, Encapsulation, Interfaces to Class, Inheritance, Generics
    > Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects. Access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`) control the visibility 
      of class members. Encapsulation refers to bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit. 
      Interfaces can be implemented by classes. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. 
      Generics enable writing reusable and type-safe components.


    class Animal {
        private name: string;
        
        constructor(name: string) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public move(distance: number): void {
            console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distance}m.`);
        }
    }

    interface Flyable {
        fly(): void;
    }

    class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
        fly(): void {
            console.log(`${this.name} is flying.`);
        }
    }

    class Box<T> {
        private item: T;

        constructor(item: T) {
            this.item = item;
        }

        getItem(): T {
            return this.item;
        }
    }

    
  1. Primitive Types:
  
  // String, Number, Boolean
  let str: string = 'Hello';
  let num: number = 42;
  let bool: boolean = true;

  // Any
  let anyValue: any = 'Any value';
  anyValue = 42; // No type error. JavaScript feature. not recommended type in TS.
  

  2. Complex Types:
  
  // Objects
  let obj: { name: string, age: number } = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

  // Arrays
  let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
  let strArr: string[] = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

  // Void (Function returning nothing)
  function logMessage(): void {
      console.log('Message logged');
  }

  // Null and Undefined
  let n: null = null;
  let u: undefined = undefined;

  // Tuples
  let tuple: [string, number] = ['John', 30];

  // Enums
  enum Direction {
      Up,
      Down,
      Left,
      Right
  }
  let userDirection: Direction = Direction.Up;

  // Generics
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
      return arg;
  }
  let output = identity<string>('hello');

  // Interfaces
  interface Person {
      name: string;
      age: number;
  }
  let person: Person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

  // Custom Types (Type alias)
  type Point = {
      x: number;
      y: number;
  };
  let point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
