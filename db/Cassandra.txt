- Cassandra is a powerful NoSQL database designed for applications requiring high availability, 
  fault tolerance, and scalability. It is particularly suited for Big Data and real-time applications. 
  While it differs from traditional relational databases by prioritizing availability and scalability over consistency, 
  its unique features make it a go-to solution for modern distributed systems.


Features of Cassandra Apache Cassandra: 
----------------------------------------
   
  - Distributed Architecture  :- Cassandra is a distributed database system that replicates data across multiple nodes to ensure 
    reliability and scalability. It uses a peer-to-peer architecture, eliminating single points of failure.

  - High Availability and Fault Tolerance :- With no single point of failure, Cassandra is designed for high availability. 
    Even if a few nodes in the cluster fail, the system continues to function seamlessly.

  - Scalability :- Cassandra is linearly scalable. You can add nodes to the cluster without downtime, 
    and the database will automatically distribute data to the new nodes.

  - Flexible Data Model :- It supports a schema-free architecture, allowing developers to store structured, semi-structured, 
    or unstructured data. Data is organized in column families, enabling easy management.

  - Tunable Consistency - Cassandra allows you to choose the consistency level depending on your use case. 
    You can prioritize availability or consistency by configuring the read and write consistency levels.

  - Write-Optimized :- Cassandra is optimized for high-speed writes, making it ideal for applications with a heavy write workload. 
    It uses a log-structured storage engine to handle massive write operations efficiently.

  - CQL (Cassandra Query Language) :- Cassandra uses CQL, which is similar to SQL, making it easier for 
    developers familiar with relational databases to work with it.

  - Time-Series Data Handling :-Cassandra excels in handling time-series data, making it suitable for 
    applications like IoT, analytics, and monitoring systems.

  - Support for Multi-Data Center Deployment :- Cassandra provides robust support for multi-data center replication, 
    ensuring low latency and high availability across geographic regions.

  - Built-in Caching :- Data can be cached to speed up read operations, further enhancing performance.


Why Do We Need Cassandra?
-------------------------

  - Big Data Applications :- Cassandra is ideal for managing large volumes of data. Applications with billions of transactions 
    or massive datasets benefit from its scalability and efficiency.

  - High Availability Requirements :- Critical systems that cannot afford downtime, such as e-commerce platforms, 
    financial systems, and IoT devices, need Cassandra for its reliability.

  - Real-Time Analytics :- Its ability to handle real-time data processing makes Cassandra suitable for 
    recommendation systems, fraud detection, and analytics platforms.

  - Global Reach Applications :- Applications requiring consistent performance across regions use Cassandra's multi-data center replication.

  - Scalable Cloud-Native Applications :- Modern cloud-based applications leverage Cassandra's ability to scale without downtime.

Important Cassandra Query Language (CQL) queries
-------------------------------------------------

  - Create a Keyspace
    - A keyspace is like a database in Cassandra.

    - CREATE KEYSPACE my_keyspace
      WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 3};

    - `SimpleStrategy`: Used for single data center.
    - `replication_factor`: Number of replicas for data.


  - Use a Keyspace
    - Switch to a specific keyspace.

      USE my_keyspace;

  - Create a Table
    Define a table with specific columns and data types.

    CREATE TABLE users (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        email TEXT,
        age INT
    );


  - Insert Data into a Table
    - Add rows of data to the table.

      INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, age) 
      VALUES (uuid(), 'Alice', 'alice@example.com', 25);


  - Select Data from a Table: Retrieve data from a table.

      - All Data: SELECT * FROM users;
      - Specific Columns: SELECT name, age FROM users;
      - Condition (Filtering): SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = cfd66ccc-d857-4e90-b1e5-df98a3d40cd6;
        

  - Update Data: Modify existing data in a table.

    UPDATE users 
    SET age = 26 
    WHERE id = cfd66ccc-d857-4e90-b1e5-df98a3d40cd6;


  - Delete Data: Remove rows or columns from a table.

    - Delete a Row: DELETE FROM users WHERE id = cfd66ccc-d857-4e90-b1e5-df98a3d40cd6;
    - Delete a Column: DELETE age FROM users WHERE id = cfd66ccc-d857-4e90-b1e5-df98a3d40cd6;
 

  - Drop a Table: Remove a table completely.

    DROP TABLE users;


  - Drop a Keyspace: Delete a keyspace and all its data.

    DROP KEYSPACE my_keyspace;


  - Create an Index: Add an index to a column for faster querying.

    CREATE INDEX ON users (email);


  - Batch Operations: Perform multiple operations in a single query.

      BEGIN BATCH
        INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, age) VALUES (uuid(), 'Bob', 'bob@example.com', 30);
        UPDATE users SET age = 31 WHERE id = cfd66ccc-d857-4e90-b1e5-df98a3d40cd6;
      APPLY BATCH;


  - Count Rows: Get the total number of rows in a table.

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;


  - Using TTL (Time to Live): Set an expiration time for data.

    INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, age) 
    VALUES (uuid(), 'Charlie', 'charlie@example.com', 28)
    USING TTL 86400; -- Expires in 1 day


  - Aggregate Functions: Perform basic aggregation (limited support in Cassandra).

    - Count:
      
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
      

  - Lightweight Transactions (Conditional Updates): Ensure updates are applied only if a condition is met.

    INSERT INTO users (id, name, email, age)
    VALUES (uuid(), 'Eve', 'eve@example.com', 22)
    IF NOT EXISTS;


  - Clustering and Ordering: Retrieve data in a specific order (works with clustering keys).

    CREATE TABLE products (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        price DECIMAL
    ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (price DESC);

    SELECT * FROM products;


  - Allow Filtering: Query on non-primary key columns (use with caution).

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 25 ALLOW FILTERING;


  - Alter a Table: Modify the structure of an existing table.

    - Add a Column:
      ALTER TABLE users ADD phone_number TEXT;
      

    - Drop a Column:
      ALTER TABLE users DROP email;
      

  - Truncate a Table: Delete all data from a table without dropping it.

    TRUNCATE TABLE users;
