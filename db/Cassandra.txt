- Cassandra is a powerful NoSQL database designed for applications requiring high availability, 
  fault tolerance, and scalability. It is particularly suited for Big Data and real-time applications. 
  While it differs from traditional relational databases by prioritizing availability and scalability over consistency, 
  its unique features make it a go-to solution for modern distributed systems.


Features of Cassandra Apache Cassandra: 
----------------------------------------
   
  - Distributed Architecture  :- Cassandra is a distributed database system that replicates data across multiple nodes to ensure 
    reliability and scalability. It uses a peer-to-peer architecture, eliminating single points of failure.

  - High Availability and Fault Tolerance :- With no single point of failure, Cassandra is designed for high availability. 
    Even if a few nodes in the cluster fail, the system continues to function seamlessly.

  - Scalability :- Cassandra is linearly scalable. You can add nodes to the cluster without downtime, 
    and the database will automatically distribute data to the new nodes.

  - Flexible Data Model :- It supports a schema-free architecture, allowing developers to store structured, semi-structured, 
    or unstructured data. Data is organized in column families, enabling easy management.

  - Tunable Consistency - Cassandra allows you to choose the consistency level depending on your use case. 
    You can prioritize availability or consistency by configuring the read and write consistency levels.

  - Write-Optimized :- Cassandra is optimized for high-speed writes, making it ideal for applications with a heavy write workload. 
    It uses a log-structured storage engine to handle massive write operations efficiently.

  - CQL (Cassandra Query Language) :- Cassandra uses CQL, which is similar to SQL, making it easier for 
    developers familiar with relational databases to work with it.

  - Time-Series Data Handling :-Cassandra excels in handling time-series data, making it suitable for 
    applications like IoT, analytics, and monitoring systems.

  - Support for Multi-Data Center Deployment :- Cassandra provides robust support for multi-data center replication, 
    ensuring low latency and high availability across geographic regions.

  - Built-in Caching :- Data can be cached to speed up read operations, further enhancing performance.


Why Do We Need Cassandra?
-------------------------

  - Big Data Applications :- Cassandra is ideal for managing large volumes of data. Applications with billions of transactions 
    or massive datasets benefit from its scalability and efficiency.

  - High Availability Requirements :- Critical systems that cannot afford downtime, such as e-commerce platforms, 
    financial systems, and IoT devices, need Cassandra for its reliability.

  - Real-Time Analytics :- Its ability to handle real-time data processing makes Cassandra suitable for 
    recommendation systems, fraud detection, and analytics platforms.

  - Global Reach Applications :- Applications requiring consistent performance across regions use Cassandra's multi-data center replication.

  - Scalable Cloud-Native Applications :- Modern cloud-based applications leverage Cassandra's ability to scale without downtime.
